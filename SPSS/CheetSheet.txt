To save the results of your analysis in SPSS, you must have the Data Editor Window open on the screen in front of you.
False


Merging files:
Adding variables: Data >> Merge Files >> Add Variables (join)

Adding cases: Data >> Merge Files >> Add Cases

Dealing with outliers:

1) Analyze  Descriptive Statistics  Discriptives ->Check Save standardized residuals(of Speed) as variables (ZSpeed)
2)Compute -> Abs(ZSpeed) - absolute value of residuals
3)Create category by the value of residual 
Lowerst to 1.96 - Category 1
1.96-Highest -> 2
2.58 to Highest->3
3.29->Highest->4
4) Analyze->Descriptive Statistics->Frequencies Check the percentage where outliers are (category 4)
Remove category 3 and 4 to remove all outliers

Other way: 
==========
Analysing outliers
1. create output for visual analysis: Alalyze/Descriptive/Explore\
2. crete z-score: analyse/descriptive/check save score as var
3. create absolute value of z- score
4. Group by z-score how much the value from deviation(sigma, 2 sigmas....)
5. remove values that are too big(small)

Normality
To assess the normality of your data, you can look at:

All of the above: 
A histogram of the data
A Normal Q-Q plot of the data
A detrended normal Q-Q plot of the data
Results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
